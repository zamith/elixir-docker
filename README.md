# Alpine based elixir docker image

This `Dockerfile` enables you to create your own Elixir and Erlang OTP docker
image using the latest version of both.

This `Dockerfile` is based on the [Alpine Linux](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/)
docker image which is a very lightweight version of Linux based on `musl libc`
and `BusyBox`.
